##The following code writes a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.

## The first function, makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix" object that 
## can cache its inverse, and does the following:

## 1. Sets the value of the matrix
## 2. Gets the value of the matrix
## 3. Sets the value of the inverse of the matrix
## 4. Gets the value of the inverse of the matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        m <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                m <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setinverse <- function(inverse) m <<- inverse
        getinverse <- function() m
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setinverse = setinverse,
             getinverse = getinverse)
}

## The following function calculates the inverse of the special "matrix" created 
## with the above function. However, it first checks to see if the inverse has 
## already been calculated. If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and skips
## the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the matrix and sets
## the value of the inverse in the cache via the setinverse function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        
        m <- x$getinverse()
        if(!is.null(m)) {
                message("getting cached data")
                return(m)
        }
        data <- x$get()
        m <- solve(data, ...)
        x$setinverse(m)
        m
}
